# This bash shell script records a live internet radio show tramsitted via HLS/DASH or Icecast/Shoutcast using ffmpeg.
# (Optional) Log script run start/end times.
# It requires ffmpeg installed. 

# IMPORTANT: See SETUP SECTION below to set paths.

# Three parameters are required
#    Station         # The name of the station streaming the show, NO SPACES ARE ALLOWED, EVER
#    NameOfShow      # Note: NO SPACES ARE ALLOWED, EVER
#    nn              # Time in minutes of recording
# e.g.
# Rec-Radio.sh KPBS MyShow 30
#
# The recorded filename will be "NameOfShow-date_time_rec.mp3"
# The recorded file will be placed under the given recording path.
# Metadata (ID3) will be added. For available tags see https://gist.github.com/eyecatchup/0757b3d8b989fe433979db2ea7d95a01
# Use cron to schedule recordings. 
#
# SETUP SECTION
# ============= 
# Change the next variables to set file paths. IMPORTANT: Do not include / on the end of paths.
# IMPORTANT: these paths must exist or the script will fail to store the recorded file, sometimes without flagging an error.
# Location of ffmpeg. If installed to a standard path, just leave this as `ffmpeg`.
# If installed to a private location, enter /full-path/ffmpeg
ffmpegPath="ffmpeg"
# Location to store recordings.
RecordingPath="$HOME/Radio-Recordings"
# Log File (optional)
# LoggingRequired can be "yes" or "no". If "yes", also set the file path for log file RecLog.txt.
LoggingRequired="yes"
LogfilePath="$HOME/Radio-Recordings"
# Details for the station to be recorded. Add as many as you wish.
